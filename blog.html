			<h1>What Does I Do?</h1>
			<p>From greek quests of old to defeat the Minotaur to Harry Potter embarking on a quest to destroy the horcruxes, the quest motif is arguably one of the most excessively employed plot devices in the realm of fantasy fiction. Given its recurrence in countless myths across cultures through the ages, its prominence in fantasy literature isn’t surprising. Due to this popularity, certain common elements exist across the concept of quests, and many theorists argue that it achieves the status of an archetype, something that readers have a general notion of, through collective consciousness. The archetypal quest, in literary discourse, has a general framework, and common elements that one notices across myths and literature old and new. This paper aims to discuss this general framework most representations of quests follow, and briefly delves into the philosophical connotations of the quest and the origins of the archetype.We also look at quests that feature in modern fantasy literature, and if they stick to the traditional pattern, and what kinds of variations might be introduced, if any. <p>

			<h2>Elements of The Quest</h2>
			<p>The quest is typically represented as a journey, a departure from all that is mundane and familiar in the hero’s life, and the hero in question is often depicted as being thrust into an unfamiliar world of trials, treachery and tragedy.<p>
			<h2>The Quester</h2>
			<p>The quester is crucial to the entire framework, and although traditionally, questers have been heroes, such as Jason in his quest for the Golden Fleece, they can be of varying age, gender, and may or may not contain the qualities of any type of a hero. But certain qualities, they must possess, such courage and endurance, and enough motivation to persevere where others might have given up. In some contexts, the selection of the hero, is done a long time before the quest comes into play, and this is often foreshadowed by depicting the circumstances of the hero’s birth as unusual, and out of the ordinary. These include signs and tragedies at the time of birth or early childhood, including demise or the inexplicable departure of parents, leaving the hero orphaned. The orphan hero is a popular one in literature, as he/she is depicted as one who has had to overcome difficulties from a young age, and the readers often sympathize with such characters easily. Notable questers with tragic childhoods include Harry Potter, the orphaned chosen-one, Eragon, and Frodo (partially, as his childhood is not ‘tragic’ per se, but he is an orphaned hero, nonetheless). Most questers are often young adults, at the brink of maturity and worldly knowledge, where they learn that mistakes begin to have grave consequences. The young hero represents the learner, as this is the age where learning happens. This also brings to one’s mind ideas of ‘rites of passage’ where young adults are put through series of difficulties and tests, often harrowing, such beatings and even mutilation. These rites of passage are meant to initiate children into the realm of adulthood and understanding, which is similar to what the quest does to the quester. Although the object might be obtained and the aim achieved, the ultimate goal or purpose of the quest is, more often than not, self discovery and understanding. The journey in the quest might be symbolic of the quester to gain wisdom, and in many stories, the quester even fails to obtain the desired object, but is always left with wisdom and understanding. This might be the origin of the archetype of the quest. Every culture in the world has some rites of passages to mark the passage of its youth to adulthood, and the idea of the quest, the notion that knowledge, wisdom and privilege has to be sought and achieved rather that simply received, might be a concept that all of us have in our collective consciousness. This is similar to the widely accepted notion that anything achieved through trials and hardship, is generally more treasured and respectable than something that is easily obtained. The point of a quest is that the object of desire is essentially hard to obtain, hence the undertaking. Also the passage from youth, where the child’s mistakes have no severe consequences, where there is a marked dependence on others and objects desired are easily handed to them, to a stage where they pay for their mistakes, where they are told to be responsible for their actions and independent, is analogous to how the hero is thrust out of a familiar, comfortable world, to one of uncomfortable discoveries and consequences. This passage into the unfamiliar represents the human need to move and change constantly. The whole idea of a quest is to foray into uncharted waters and not remain where one is, to find, to explore. </p>
			<h2>The Object</h2>
			<p>Also central to the quest is an object, the ultimate treasure, which acts as the primary motivation for the initiation of the quest. The object of the desire has appeared in many forms throughout literature, whether it be the quest for the Golden Fleece, the Apples of Hesperides,  The Holy Grail, Fountain of Youth. Sometimes, the ‘treasure’ isn’t even material, it is more tangible in the terms of concept or knowledge. In any case, it has to be something that is of immense import to the quester, or the hero. It holds a promise of a different life or circumstances, for the hero themselves or others, and this promise is crucial, as this is what is the driving force for the quester to continue on the quest. When it is centrally a self driven desire to achieve something on the quest, it is more likely to be due to the fact that the quester wishes to rid himself/herself of fears, weaknesses, escape unfavourable circumstances. In other times, the typical self sacrificing hero, who is willing to undergo hardships for the good of the society. This is a common theme that is explored in various texts, such as in the Inheritance Cycle, where the young hero, Eragon, must defeat the evil king Galbatorix for the welfare of all the races that exist through the land.
			This aim may be of obtaining object of desire, more aptly known as a quest of possession, wherein our quester gains power, knowledge, or tools in order to serve a greater purpose of ensuring general welfare, or destruction of an enemy, or to save a loved one, to name a few. The converse to this type of quest, is the quest of dispossession, where in the quester seeks to lose, or destroy the object in question, a concept made popular by Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, where the primary aim is to destroy the ring. The quest of dispossession has, inherently, a more complex framework, as the object is question would be a source of interest and temptation for multiple parties (including the quester themself), therefore ensuring that the quester has to face an internal struggle along with dealing with trials and tribulations from external forces. The internal struggle is a common theme across representations of the archetypal quest, the quester facing doubts and setbacks from which the quester finds it difficult to continue on the quest. 
			</p>
			<h2>The Journey (or The Quest Itself)</h2>
			<p>The way to obtain the object is the journey itself. The physical journey is rife with dangers and to overcome them, is a crucial part of the quest. More often than not, these difficulties challenge the nature and notions of the quester and inevitable, the quester is changed in the course of the journey. The trials, up until the very end of the quest, seek to put the quester through the fire, so as to speak, in order for the questers themselves to discover their hidden selves, or parts of it, at least. In The Lord Of The Rings, we see Frodo, the ultimate embodiment of the good and someone who initially could not be tempted by the power of the ring, not willing to destroy it when the time came and ultimately fall prey to the ring. In Harry Potter, the readers see the horcruxes bring out the worst in the central trio, preying on their weaknesses and fears. In Pullman’s His Dark Materials, young Will is forced to kill people, and he himself is disgusted by the fact, before he comes to discover that he is a warrior, and to be true to his nature, he must fight and kill. These transformations, accumulated, form part of the self knowledge that is acquired at the end of the quest, and these challenges often prove to be useful in achieving the ultimate goal at the end of the quest, such as accidentally discovering powers. In Le Guin’s  A Wizard of Earthsea, Ged, obtains the knowledge of bringing back people from the dead, and tries to use this information in a duel against Jasper. This resulted in dire consequences, as Ged had unleashed a shadow that would follow him till the ends of the world. But in this entire process. He learned that magic and power, if misused, can be fatal, and that a balance must be maintained. The transformation that the quester undergoes in the journey, by losing some parts of character and gaining others, is also difficult primarily because the questers themselves have to face hard truths which they cannot simply accept. It requires great strength of character to acknowledge that who one was, is not who one is anymore.
			The Hero’s journey, and the general framework that this follows in the context of a quest or an adventure, has been highly theorized upon, most notably in Joseph Campbell’s Monomyth:
			“A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.”
			- Joseph Campbell

			In the monomyth, the hero’s journey, is classified into 17 stages, which are grouped under three main categories: Departure, wherein the hero receives a call for the adventure, Initiation, in which the hero actually delves into the special realm or the unknown, and in Return, the hero returns to the ordinary world, as a transformed person. 
			Although this might seem too general a framework, it can prove to be quite useful in analysing quest centric fantasy literature, and hence prompts a discussion of a few important elements. In the Departure phase, the ‘ordinary world is shown’, in order to later highlight the contrast between the ordinary world and the ‘new’, unfamiliar world. The hero is then presented with the challenge or adventure, which he/she might be reluctant to answer because of the fear of the unknown. At this point the quester is still contemplating whether to actually commit to the quest, and further motivation is required, most often in the form of a distressing circumstance that furthers the immediacy for beginning the quest. This can be seen in Eragon, where Eragon begins the journey with his mentor, Brom, and leaves Carvahall when the Ra’zac murder his uncle. Another important point to note is that the quester, at least in the initial part of his/her journey is guided or accompanied by a mentor, an experienced individual, to help the quester in his exploration of the unfamiliar world, and to impart valuable knowledge. Examples of mentors in popular Fantasy fiction include Brom, in Eragon, Aragorn and Gandalf in The Fellowship of the Ring, Albus Dumbledore in Harry Potter, and Ogion in A Wizard of Earthsea. The next stage after overcoming the initial reluctance is when the hero or the quester actually commits to the quest. The next phase is where the quester faces the initial hardships, meets people, discovers parts of this ‘new’ world, and in this process, the hero’s nature and moral character is revealed. The next couple of stages include the hero’s foray into the darker parts of the world, where he is close to facing the ultimate challenge, which he eventually does. This ultimate challenge is usually a confrontation with the hero’s greatest fear or weakness, and throughout this trial, the hero faces the constant danger of death and destruction. In this stage, the hero must ‘die’ and be ‘reborn’ in order to survive. In this process of rebirth, we see connotations to the rites of passage, where a new individual is born, in a sense. Only after success in this stage, can the hero claim the treasure or the object of desire for which the quest was initiated. The perils don’t end here, as the hero must deal with the ordeals after confrontation with the great enemy, and might require help in returning to the ordinary world. After this, there might be another, final confrontation with evil, where in the hero goes through another rebirth in order to finally triumph. After this, the quest is finally completed and the hero can return to the ordinary world, after gaining the sense of purpose that the journey of the quests imparts.
			Observing the general framework, we can spot patterns in many existing works of quest centric fantasy, as in Pullman’s His Dark Materials, where Will Parry and Lyra Belacqua lose some parts of their old selves, and are thrust into an unknown world. Both of them initially express reluctance and despair in the circumstances, but soon learn to adapt. The lack of a single constant mentor through the series is quite interesting, and reveals a deeper play where children and adults are separate and the worlds of childhood and adulthood are vastly separated, with the mysterious Dust being one of the separating factors. This, again, in reminiscent of the rites of passage.
			Throughout the ages, human imagination and creativity has always been drawn to quests, as it gives a change for individuals to prove themselves in the larger scheme of things. The Journey, while shaping the outcome of the quest, also shapes heroes and questers and is of great import in every world. As Le Guin puts it, “It is good to have an end to journey toward, but it is the journey that matters in the end”.
