			<header style = 'font-family: Impact, Charcoal, sans-serif; font-size: 40px'>The Quest for the Quest</header>
			<p >From greek quests of old to defeat the Minotaur to Harry Potter embarking on a quest to destroy the horcruxes, the quest motif is arguably one of the most excessively employed plot devices in the realm of fantasy fiction. Given its recurrence in countless myths across cultures through the ages, its prominence in fantasy literature isn’t surprising. Due to this popularity, certain common elements exist across the concept of quests, and many theorists argue that it achieves the status of an archetype, something that readers have a general notion of, through collective consciousness. The archetypal quest, in literary discourse, has a general framework, and common elements that one notices across myths and literature old and new. This paper aims to discuss this general framework most representations of quests follow, and briefly delves into the philosophical connotations of the quest and the origins of the archetype.We also look at quests that feature in modern fantasy literature, and if they stick to the traditional pattern, and what kinds of variations might be introduced, if any. <p>

			<h1 style = 'font-family: Impact, Charcoal, sans-serif;'>Elements of The Quest</h1>
			<p >The quest is typically represented as a journey, a departure from all that is mundane and familiar in the hero’s life, and the hero in question is often depicted as being thrust into an unfamiliar world of trials, treachery and tragedy.<p>
			<h1 style = 'font-family: Impact, Charcoal, sans-serif;'>The Quester</h1>
			<p>The quester is crucial to the entire framework, and although traditionally, questers have been heroes, such as Jason in his quest for the Golden Fleece, they can be of varying age, gender, and may or may not contain the qualities of any type of a hero. But certain qualities, they must possess, such courage and endurance, and enough motivation to persevere where others might have given up. In some contexts, the selection of the hero, is done a long time before the quest comes into play, and this is often foreshadowed by depicting the circumstances of the hero’s birth as unusual, and out of the ordinary. These include signs and tragedies at the time of birth or early childhood, including demise or the inexplicable departure of parents, leaving the hero orphaned. The orphan hero is a popular one in literature, as he/she is depicted as one who has had to overcome difficulties from a young age, and the readers often sympathize with such characters easily. Notable questers with tragic childhoods include Harry Potter, the orphaned chosen-one, Eragon, and Frodo (partially, as his childhood is not ‘tragic’ per se, but he is an orphaned hero, nonetheless). Most questers are often young adults, at the brink of maturity and worldly knowledge, where they learn that mistakes begin to have grave consequences. The young hero represents the learner, as this is the age where learning happens. This also brings to one’s mind ideas of ‘rites of passage’ where young adults are put through series of difficulties and tests, often harrowing, such beatings and even mutilation. These rites of passage are meant to initiate children into the realm of adulthood and understanding, which is similar to what the quest does to the quester. Although the object might be obtained and the aim achieved, the ultimate goal or purpose of the quest is, more often than not, self discovery and understanding. The journey in the quest might be symbolic of the quester to gain wisdom, and in many stories, the quester even fails to obtain the desired object, but is always left with wisdom and understanding. This might be the origin of the archetype of the quest. Every culture in the world has some rites of passages to mark the passage of its youth to adulthood, and the idea of the quest, the notion that knowledge, wisdom and privilege has to be sought and achieved rather that simply received, might be a concept that all of us have in our collective consciousness. This is similar to the widely accepted notion that anything achieved through trials and hardship, is generally more treasured and respectable than something that is easily obtained. The point of a quest is that the object of desire is essentially hard to obtain, hence the undertaking. Also the passage from youth, where the child’s mistakes have no severe consequences, where there is a marked dependence on others and objects desired are easily handed to them, to a stage where they pay for their mistakes, where they are told to be responsible for their actions and independent, is analogous to how the hero is thrust out of a familiar, comfortable world, to one of uncomfortable discoveries and consequences. This passage into the unfamiliar represents the human need to move and change constantly. The whole idea of a quest is to foray into uncharted waters and not remain where one is, to find, to explore. </p>
			<h1 style = 'font-family: Impact, Charcoal, sans-serif;'>The Object</h1>
			<p>Also central to the quest is an object, the ultimate treasure, which acts as the primary motivation for the initiation of the quest. The object of the desire has appeared in many forms throughout literature, whether it be the quest for the Golden Fleece, the Apples of Hesperides,  The Holy Grail, Fountain of Youth. Sometimes, the ‘treasure’ isn’t even material, it is more tangible in the terms of concept or knowledge. In any case, it has to be something that is of immense import to the quester, or the hero. It holds a promise of a different life or circumstances, for the hero themselves or others, and this promise is crucial, as this is what is the driving force for the quester to continue on the quest. When it is centrally a self driven desire to achieve something on the quest, it is more likely to be due to the fact that the quester wishes to rid himself/herself of fears, weaknesses, escape unfavourable circumstances. In other times, the typical self sacrificing hero, who is willing to undergo hardships for the good of the society. This is a common theme that is explored in various texts, such as in the Inheritance Cycle, where the young hero, Eragon, must defeat the evil king Galbatorix for the welfare of all the races that exist through the land.
			This aim may be of obtaining object of desire, more aptly known as a quest of possession, wherein our quester gains power, knowledge, or tools in order to serve a greater purpose of ensuring general welfare, or destruction of an enemy, or to save a loved one, to name a few. The converse to this type of quest, is the quest of dispossession, where in the quester seeks to lose, or destroy the object in question, a concept made popular by Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, where the primary aim is to destroy the ring. The quest of dispossession has, inherently, a more complex framework, as the object is question would be a source of interest and temptation for multiple parties (including the quester themself), therefore ensuring that the quester has to face an internal struggle along with dealing with trials and tribulations from external forces. The internal struggle is a common theme across representations of the archetypal quest, the quester facing doubts and setbacks from which the quester finds it difficult to continue on the quest. 
			</p>
			<h1 style = 'font-family: Impact, Charcoal, sans-serif;'>The Journey (or The Quest Itself)</h1>
			<p>The way to obtain the object is the journey itself. The physical journey is rife with dangers and to overcome them, is a crucial part of the quest. More often than not, these difficulties challenge the nature and notions of the quester and inevitable, the quester is changed in the course of the journey. The trials, up until the very end of the quest, seek to put the quester through the fire, so as to speak, in order for the questers themselves to discover their hidden selves, or parts of it, at least. In The Lord Of The Rings, we see Frodo, the ultimate embodiment of the good and someone who initially could not be tempted by the power of the ring, not willing to destroy it when the time came and ultimately fall prey to the ring. In Harry Potter, the readers see the horcruxes bring out the worst in the central trio, preying on their weaknesses and fears. In Pullman’s His Dark Materials, young Will is forced to kill people, and he himself is disgusted by the fact, before he comes to discover that he is a warrior, and to be true to his nature, he must fight and kill. These transformations, accumulated, form part of the self knowledge that is acquired at the end of the quest, and these challenges often prove to be useful in achieving the ultimate goal at the end of the quest, such as accidentally discovering powers. In Le Guin’s  A Wizard of Earthsea, Ged, obtains the knowledge of bringing back people from the dead, and tries to use this information in a duel against Jasper. This resulted in dire consequences, as Ged had unleashed a shadow that would follow him till the ends of the world. But in this entire process. He learned that magic and power, if misused, can be fatal, and that a balance must be maintained. The transformation that the quester undergoes in the journey, by losing some parts of character and gaining others, is also difficult primarily because the questers themselves have to face hard truths which they cannot simply accept. It requires great strength of character to acknowledge that who one was, is not who one is anymore.
			The Hero’s journey, and the general framework that this follows in the context of a quest or an adventure, has been highly theorized upon, most notably in Joseph Campbell’s Monomyth:
			“A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.”
			- Joseph Campbell

			In the monomyth, the hero’s journey, is classified into 17 stages, which are grouped under three main categories: Departure, wherein the hero receives a call for the adventure, Initiation, in which the hero actually delves into the special realm or the unknown, and in Return, the hero returns to the ordinary world, as a transformed person. 
			Although this might seem too general a framework, it can prove to be quite useful in analysing quest centric fantasy literature, and hence prompts a discussion of a few important elements. In the Departure phase, the ‘ordinary world is shown’, in order to later highlight the contrast between the ordinary world and the ‘new’, unfamiliar world. The hero is then presented with the challenge or adventure, which he/she might be reluctant to answer because of the fear of the unknown. At this point the quester is still contemplating whether to actually commit to the quest, and further motivation is required, most often in the form of a distressing circumstance that furthers the immediacy for beginning the quest. This can be seen in Eragon, where Eragon begins the journey with his mentor, Brom, and leaves Carvahall when the Ra’zac murder his uncle. Another important point to note is that the quester, at least in the initial part of his/her journey is guided or accompanied by a mentor, an experienced individual, to help the quester in his exploration of the unfamiliar world, and to impart valuable knowledge. Examples of mentors in popular Fantasy fiction include Brom, in Eragon, Aragorn and Gandalf in The Fellowship of the Ring, Albus Dumbledore in Harry Potter, and Ogion in A Wizard of Earthsea. The next stage after overcoming the initial reluctance is when the hero or the quester actually commits to the quest. The next phase is where the quester faces the initial hardships, meets people, discovers parts of this ‘new’ world, and in this process, the hero’s nature and moral character is revealed. The next couple of stages include the hero’s foray into the darker parts of the world, where he is close to facing the ultimate challenge, which he eventually does. This ultimate challenge is usually a confrontation with the hero’s greatest fear or weakness, and throughout this trial, the hero faces the constant danger of death and destruction. In this stage, the hero must ‘die’ and be ‘reborn’ in order to survive. In this process of rebirth, we see connotations to the rites of passage, where a new individual is born, in a sense. Only after success in this stage, can the hero claim the treasure or the object of desire for which the quest was initiated. The perils don’t end here, as the hero must deal with the ordeals after confrontation with the great enemy, and might require help in returning to the ordinary world. After this, there might be another, final confrontation with evil, where in the hero goes through another rebirth in order to finally triumph. After this, the quest is finally completed and the hero can return to the ordinary world, after gaining the sense of purpose that the journey of the quests imparts.
			Observing the general framework, we can spot patterns in many existing works of quest centric fantasy, as in Pullman’s His Dark Materials, where Will Parry and Lyra Belacqua lose some parts of their old selves, and are thrust into an unknown world. Both of them initially express reluctance and despair in the circumstances, but soon learn to adapt. The lack of a single constant mentor through the series is quite interesting, and reveals a deeper play where children and adults are separate and the worlds of childhood and adulthood are vastly separated, with the mysterious Dust being one of the separating factors. This, again, in reminiscent of the rites of passage.
			Throughout the ages, human imagination and creativity has always been drawn to quests, as it gives a change for individuals to prove themselves in the larger scheme of things. The Journey, while shaping the outcome of the quest, also shapes heroes and questers and is of great import in every world. As Le Guin puts it, “It is good to have an end to journey toward, but it is the journey that matters in the end”.

			<header style = 'font-family: Impact, Charcoal, sans-serif; font-size:40px'>Mythology and Fanatasy Fiction</header>
			<p>Fantasy Literature and Mythology, while seemingly disparate or individual entities, have an intrinsically symbiotic relationship. Fantasy Fiction is heavily reliant on mythology in the sense that while building new worlds and reimagining concepts of the elements that might constitute a 'reality' or a ‘world’, a reader needs to identify with the elements, in however small a sense. The concept of mythology is embedded into culture, it might even be the focal point or the birthplace of culture and traditions. Every culture has myths, whether they are myths about creation, heroes or creatures and discourse on these myths is, again, integral to traditions of storytelling. This effectively ensures that every individual who identifies with a particular culture has certain notions and ideas about the 'fantastic'. This creates a bridge, a connection of relatability for readers of fantasy fiction or any literature that draws on the ideas presented in these myths. ‘The reader requires a mythology which is both familiar but also new in some way’[1]. A lot of the alternative worlds or realities use elements of existing mythologies, which isn't surprising, if one thinks about myths also being fantasy fiction at one point of time. The idea of the supernatural or the otherworldly has always had an element of irresistibility to it, which certainly aids the propagation of stories and tales relating to those ideas. When these gain immense popularity among particular sects or groups of people, they are compelled to add to the tales, and to introduce new heroes and stories within the ‘world’ already established in these stories, or tales, which might not have quite reached the stage of being a ‘myth’ yet. When these narrations become so comprehensive in detail and richness  that they are known and told and retold by such a large scale of people in a manner that they become ‘believable’ - this is when belief starts, and this is the point of time where they stop being just stories, and become myths. </p>

			<h1 style = 'font-family: Impact, Charcoal, sans-serif;'>Mythology, Faith and the production of meaning</h1>
			<p>It is definitely arguable that this belief can also result in faith - and essentially, it does. The bible is no more than a narration - but it is made strong by the belief invested within it. Whether it is the Bible, the Gita, or the Harry Potter books one swears by - in each, we see a following, or a sect of people for whom it's more than just a narration. The religion begins here. What greater appreciation for a story than to have people be so immersed in it that they believe it to be the absolute truth? This might be the reason that we see so much Christian, Ancient Greek or pagan imagery in fiction all over the world. Some ideologies or concepts are too deeply ingrained to deviate from - for example the presence of a benevolent, all-knowing, omnipotent character in fantasy fiction - a figure representative of God. One might even call the presence of such a character an archetype. At the very end of the last Harry Potter book, the protagonist enters a dream-like state after being hit by a killing curse, in a place described as pure and peaceful, and one immediately thinks of heaven. Here, Dumbledore (the omnipotent character in this series) appears as a counsellor, and when you’re in Heaven, who can counsel you other than God? Aslan might be seen as another example of a figure representative of God, and the similarities to Jesus are uncanny, such as the manner of death and rebirth, the astounding powers, and his role as the creator and the saviour of Narnia. The creation myth in the world of Narnia is that Aslan created the world with a song, which is similar to how God ,according to christian theology, is said to have created the world as we know it, with the famous words “Let there be light”. This is a method in which the narrators of a tale can ensure that the reader can relate to it - by imbibing elements (either consciously or unconsciously) of popular faiths and beliefs in their narrative so that it aids recognizability and comprehensibility. This facilitates the construction of world by the reader, providing him with the tools to do so, and this is an essential component in the production of meaning. Everything that is narrated has to be constricted or reinvented in the mind of the reader for it to be truly understood. It is only after the production of meaning, can one start to truly believe in a myth or a story and until then, it is just a text being read. So it is imperative for the author to construct worlds in a manner such that there is a balance in the familiar and unfamiliar, so that it is mysterious enough for the reader to create the said world.</p>
			<p>What happens, then, if the reader cannot construct worlds and fantastical elements simply because it is too ‘wild’ to imagine? Everyone has different metrics and standards for recognizability and for some people who haven't been surrounded with a culture of myths and tales but rather by, say, more scientific fact, it might be hard to imagine that there exist Archmages who can bring back ‘shadows’ from the realm of death and dragons who can communicate with other beings. This might be a very valid constraint for the past few generation and even more so for the generations to come. Myths originated in order to explain or communicate what cannot be easily or directly understood. For example Zeus and Poseidon were invented because lightning and the movement of waves could not be explained. In modern science, when it has been explained that waves are caused due to the gravitational pull of the moon, why should people choose to believe that Poseidon is responsible or if Poseidon even exists? This is precisely because science functions as what is recognizable as truth in modern culture, just as magic and mythology functioned as the truth in archaic cultures. Although it might be difficult to ‘defamiliarize’ oneself from what one perceives as the truth, it is not impossible. Imagination plays a massive role here, for it is required to have a stronger influence on one’s belief than reason does. The reverse can be argued as true for the creator(s) of the myth - what the reader would perceive as a figment of imagination, is the creator’s world, belief and reason, or should be, in any case. </p>
			<h1 style = 'font-family: Impact, Charcoal, sans-serif;'>Fantasy Fiction to Myth</h1>
			<p>According to Joseph Campbell in The Power of Myth, “Myths are clues to the spiritual potentialities of human life”. Mythopoeia is a genre in literature and film in which myths are created by a writer [5]. Tolkien believed that when a person penned down myths, they weren’t lies or fallacies, but a creative expression of, what is essentially, the truth. This expression was mythopoeia[5][7].<p>

			<em>"In making a myth, in practicing 'mythopoeia,' and peopling the world with elves and dragons and goblins, a story-teller .. is actually fulfilling God's purpose, and reflecting a splintered fragment of the true light."                                                                                            Tolkien</em>

			<p>Although Tolkien viewed mythopoeia as the fulfilment of a holy purpose, I think, that this ‘purpose’ can be replaced by any form of belief that is perceived equally strongly by any writer intending their work to become a legend. These notions of myth creation are a  few of the reasons that a lot of the myths are viewed as histories rather than just tales.<p>

			<p><em>“I had a mind to make a body of more or less connected legend, ranging from the large and cosmogonic, to the level of romantic fairy-story - the larger founded on the lesser in contact with the earth, the lesser drawing splendour from the vast backcloths - which I could dedicate simply to: to England; to my country. ... I would draw some of the great tales in fullness, and leave many only placed in the scheme, and sketched. The cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama.” </em>                                                                                                                                        Tolkien[7]</p>

			<p>Tolkien created Middle-Earth in order to fill the mythological gap of England, and he perceived his extensive world of hobbits, wizards and elves not as another world, but some part of a history that occurred millennia ago. His careful construction of the entire world, equipping the legendarium with creation myths, a religion of sorts, a consortium of beings, lands, narratives, and the sheer attention to detail would leave no doubt that it is indeed written with the purpose that some being, some day would see the ‘truth’ embedded within his work [4]. When asked how the series would end, Tolkien replied that he shall try to ‘find out’, and this implies that he is merely discovering the truth and not producing it. The same way that a reader might ‘discover’ the truth within a fantasy novel. If all of the participants involved in the production of meaning, the readers and the authors of these myths, are discovering the truth, doesn’t it make the author simply a narrator of the ‘truth’ as well? Here, one gets the impression that the narrator is not omniscient, that they do not know everything, but simply communicate what they know, which is definitely more that what the reader knows at any point, but is still not everything. Does this imply that no narrator of fantasy fiction is omniscient? This might be true if all of fantasy fiction is written, intentionally or unintentionally, as a myth. 
			Does the idea of myth depend on the detail with which the world is constructed? If we think along the lines Tolkien, if myth is ultimately the truth, the details could be any representation of the truth. If a myth isn’t written with the idea of truth and belief, but rather as ‘lies breathed through silver’ as C.S.Lewis put it, can they be read and understood as the same? Again, it comes back to the production of meaning and whether one can truly achieve that without belief, and that is a personal understanding, either aided by the detail or lack thereof. 
			Essentially, everybody believes in something as the truth, whether it is religion, god, karma, nature, science or even the concept of nothing - and it is this truth that shapes any narrative. When the tales that have been established as myths - such as, the Odyssey or Mahabharata, are considered - one might mostly credit them as being the original sources of belief (as they were extremely popular, to say at the least), and this is the reason, as mentioned earlier, that we see so many allusions or similarities in concepts and elements from certain prominent texts. The idea of being inspired by a text or a concept is heavily reliant, again on the production of meaning, but not entirely on it. Inspiration involves understanding, at some level, of the fundamental thought process that the source is attempting to convey, along with whatever one might make further of that understanding. The representation of this understanding is in different ways, and this is crucially what makes a story.
			Several authors credit Tolkien for being their inspiration, including but not limited to Le Guin and Paolini. If Le Guin was inspired by the idea of a quest of disposition and the downfall of power that is featured so prominently in The Lord of the Rings, one might view that essential concept as some part of the ‘truth’ that is embedded in the Earth Sea Sequence, as that is what the writer believes as right and true. Afterall, inspiration might be considered as the highest form of belief. When Tolkien talks about the ‘purpose’, one might contemplate about it as simply the expression of his belief(s), and it is this expression that is either the source or result of inspiration. For example, the unachievability of complete immortality for humans. Achilles is said to have bathed in the river Styx in order to be immortal, by his mother, who held him by his ankle, and subsequently Achilles’ only vulnerable part became his heel. In the german myth Nibelungenlied, the hero, Siegfried, bathed in the blood of the dragon he slayed, which was supposed make him immortal. But due to a leaf  falling on a small patch of the skin, it became his one vulnerable point. These point of vulnerability or weakness were meant to signify that no human can be omnipotent - that was reserved for the Gods. It appears that most myths and works of fantasy are derivatives of already existing beliefs. </p>
			<h1 style = 'font-family: Impact, Charcoal, sans-serif;'>Allusions in Modern Fantasy Fiction</h1>
			<p>The Odyssey, the epic poem by Homer, has come to mean a long difficult journey and this concept of a journey and quest through trials is one of the most consistently occurring themes in fantasy literature. The Hobbit, for instance, describes the Bilbo’s challenging journey to defeat Smaug, the parallel to the cyclops, Polyphemus, that Odysseus had to battle. Parallels can be drawn across Harry Potter and Odysseus, both trying to find a home, a place to fit in [2]. The communication with ghosts in order to seek advice about the future is also a common theme across the works. The use of names such as Hermione, Minerva, Narcissa depict heavy influences from ancient Greek mythology. In The Chronicles of Narnia, the fauns draw upon the centaurs of Greek mythology. Norse mythology also features prominently across fantasy literature, primarily in Tolkien’s work. Der Ring des Nibelungen, Wagner’s epic musical drama, was based loosely on Norse myths and Nibelungenlied. It featured a ring which had the power to rule the world, much like Tolkien’s ‘one ring to rule them all’. Tolkien is said to have been influenced by Finnish and Celtic mythology as well. Gandalf has been compared to Merlin, the wizard in Arthurian legends. In Le Guin’s work we see similarity to chinese philosophy in the balance between light and dark, across the shadow world and how there must be balance in all power. The dragons across LOTR, Harry Potter, Inheritance cycle and the Earth Sea Sequence are derived from classic myths related to dragons across various cultures - including the Chinese and European dragons. Relatively newer works such as Cassandra Clare’s Mortal Instruments series has numerous apparent references to angels from the Bible. Riordan’s Percy Jackson series is almost entirely based on greek mythology and the idea of demigods, or children of the gods. The initiation rites of young heroes across the realm of the fantasy genre are derived from various different cultures - most of which include trials and ritualistic cleansing.  
			We can also examine the influences that these works have had on future works of fantasy literature. Le Guin’s wizard school has undoubtedly been a source of inspiration for Rowling’s Hogwarts. Gandalf can even be seen as the inspiration for Dumbledore, if we consider the scale of their powers and even the similarities in the descriptions of their appearance - long beard, wizard hat, and Gandalf’s staff replaced for a wand. Voldemort and Sauron can be seen as similar ‘Dark Lords’. 
			The idea of the ‘true name’ in Paolini’s Inheritance Cycle has concepts of Le Guin’s true name, something so potent that it gives complete power over an individual and his identity to another, if known. One can see the direct Influence that Tolkien has had on Paolini, with many of the characters having names such as Eragon and Arya, similar to Aragorn and Arwen.
			It is a mark of the power, depth and magic that is present in works of Tolkien and Le Guin that so much of the current fantasy fiction is influenced by them[3]. Elves, dwarfs, wizards, dragons and many more of the elements within these works have been a source of imagination and inspiration for countless writers that set out to create fantasy fiction. That is the reason that an entire genre is dedicated to ‘Post-Tolkienian Fantasy’.
			One might argue that when a piece of work has moved and heralded readers all over the world and inspired generation of writers, can it be said that this work actually reached the status of a myth? If we think about it, in the years and millennia to come, it would be hard to construct classical fantasy worlds without having at least a small element of Tolkien’s embedded within the work. So much so, that archetypes in post 20th century fantasy fiction might be able to trace their origins back to Middle-Earth. It even has all the right ingredients to be declared as a myth - people believe in it, it is regarded as an important lesson to all of mankind - do not mess with power, it is told and retold countless times, in different ways (such as the movies fanfiction, art, songs) and it has truly reached cult status. But the most important element of all of these is that it has taught countless people the wonders that could be created through imagination and belief. This, according to me, is the mark of a true myth.</p>
